# Collaboration and Tool Usage
## Use of Tools

I use GitHub Copilot in the VS Code editor mainly for:
- breaking down task instructions,
- writing tests,
- confirming the plan,
- discussing and brainstorming the task,
- writing documentation.

The tool helps me solve tasks faster, verify ideas, and improve code quality.
